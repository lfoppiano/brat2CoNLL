# Readme

This repo contains code to convert Named entity recognition annotations in Brat standoff format to CoNLL format. This is a format usable by HuggingFace for training Bert based NER models.

## Usage

The code assumes that all the input files i.e., *.ann and corresponding *.txt files are located in a single directory i.e., input_directory. Run the code to print the output of all annotations to the output_file.

    python brat2CoNLL/convert.py --input_dir={input_directory} --output_file={output_file}

You can use the provided sample annotations to test the code

To run the test use (if using pytest):

    pytest tests/test_brat2conll.py

The sample input annotations are taken from the sample dataset used for the CheMU 2020 NER task [1]
